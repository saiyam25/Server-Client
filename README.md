## Echo Server & Client

This project demonstrates a basic TCP echo server and client using Python's built-in `socket` module.

## Features
- Accepts one client connection at a time.
- Echoes back any message sent by the client.
- Gracefully closes when the client types `exit`.

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Server

`python3 echoserver.py`

### 2. Start Client Connection

`python3 client.py`
