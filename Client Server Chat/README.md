# Simple Chat System Using Python TCP Sockets

This is a **basic two-way chat system** using Python's built-in `socket` module. Both the **server** and the **client** take turns sending and receiving messages over a TCP connection.

## Features

- Built using TCP sockets.
- Interactive chat: server and client send messages in turn.
- Gracefully exits both sides when types `exit`.
